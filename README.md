# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis
The objective of this analysis was to integrate a recent finding into the key performance metrics of the school district, namely that there is academic dishonesty at a particular school (Thomas High School) in a particular grade (9th). In this hypothetical audit of highschool reading and math scores within a school district, I have been instructed to systemically disregard the scores of Thomas High School's 9th grade math and reading scores and, furthermore, asked to to rerun the analysis. This write up is intended to describe how these changes affected the district analysis.
